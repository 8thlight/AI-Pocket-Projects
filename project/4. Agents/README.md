# Phase 4: Multi-Agent Systems ü§ñ

*Learn agent orchestration patterns with LangGraph or AutoGen*

## What You're Building

A **standalone multi-agent system** to explore:
- **Agent Orchestration**: How multiple AI agents work together
- **Framework Patterns**: Choose your agent framework (LangGraph or AutoGen)
- **Tool Usage**: How agents decide when and how to use different tools
- **Research Workflows**: Multi-step reasoning and information synthesis

**üìö Implementation Details:** 
- **Track A (LangGraph)**: See [`LANGGRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md`](LANGGRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed workflow implementation
- **Track B (AutoGen)**: See [`AUTOGEN_ARCHITECTURE.md`](AUTOGEN_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed conversation-based implementation

## Your Mission: 2-Week Agent Exploration

Learn multi-agent patterns by building a research system that demonstrates key agent concepts. This is a **separate learning project** - your Phase 1-3 system remains complete and valuable as-is.

### **Week 1: Core Agent Framework**

#### **Day 1-3: Framework Setup & Basic Agent Interaction**

**Your Mission:** Get your chosen framework working with basic agent interactions.

### **Track A: LangGraph Implementation**

**What to Build:**
- **Router Node** - Intent classification using conditional edges
- **Simple Agent Node** - Basic response generation  
- **State Schema** - Define AgentState with messages and routing decisions
- **Basic Graph** - Connect router ‚Üí agent ‚Üí end

**Key Learning:**
```python
def router_node(state: AgentState):
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if "research" in last_message.content.lower():
        return {"routing_decision": "research"}
    return {"routing_decision": "simple"}

workflow.add_conditional_edges("router", 
    lambda state: state["routing_decision"],
    {"simple": "simple_agent", "research": "research_planner"}
)
```

### **Track B: AutoGen Implementation**

**What to Build:**
- **User Proxy Agent** - Handles user interaction and task initiation
- **Research Assistant** - Primary research agent with web search tools
- **Quality Critic** - Reviews and improves research outputs
- **Group Chat** - Coordinate multi-agent conversations

**Key Learning:**
```python
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy", 
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False}
)

researcher = AssistantAgent("researcher",
    system_message="You research topics thoroughly using available tools"
)

critic = AssistantAgent("critic", 
    system_message="You review research and suggest improvements"
)
```

**üéÆ Side Quest:** Experiment with different routing prompts, add confidence scoring for routing decisions.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha:** Router needs to be fast (< 1 second) and accurate. Test with diverse query types.

#### **Day 4-7: Multi-Agent Research Workflow**

**Your Mission:** Build the complete research workflow with multiple agents.

### **Track A: LangGraph Multi-Agent Chain**

**What to Build:**
- **Research Planner Node** - Breaks down complex topics
- **Research Gatherer Node** - Collects information using tools
- **Report Builder Node** - Synthesizes comprehensive reports
- **Tool Node** - Shared tool execution (Perplexity, knowledge base)
- **Conditional Logic** - Smart routing based on research completeness

**Key Learning:**
```python
def research_gatherer_node(state: AgentState):
    # Agent decides which tools to use
    if needs_web_research(state):
        return call_perplexity_tool(state)
    elif needs_knowledge_base(state):
        return call_kb_search_tool(state)
    else:
        return {"messages": [AIMessage("Research complete")]}

workflow.add_conditional_edges("research_gatherer",
    lambda state: "continue" if has_tool_calls(state) else "build_report"
)
```

### **Track B: AutoGen Research Team**

**What to Build:**
- **Topic Planner Agent** - Breaks down research topics
- **Knowledge Researcher Agent** - Searches knowledge bases  
- **Web Researcher Agent** - Handles web search and synthesis
- **Report Writer Agent** - Creates comprehensive markdown reports
- **Research Coordinator** - Orchestrates the research team

**Key Learning:**
```python
# Agents work together through conversation
groupchat = GroupChat(
    agents=[planner, knowledge_researcher, web_researcher, writer],
    messages=[],
    max_round=10
)

manager = GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=config)

user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    manager,
    message="Research the evolution of transformer architectures"
)
```

**Research Tools:**
- `research_topic_breakdown` - Creates structured research plan
- `search_knowledge_base` - Returns [KB-X] sources from your Phase 1 system
- `perplexity_search` - Returns [WEB-X] sources with AI-powered deep research
- `create_report_outline` - Structures comprehensive reports

**üéÆ Side Quest:** Add research quality scoring, implement iterative refinement loops.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha:** Multi-agent workflows can get complex fast. Start simple and add complexity incrementally.

### **Week 2: Integration & Production**

#### **Day 8-10: Agent Patterns & Tools**
**Your Mission:** Learn core agent patterns and tool usage.

**What to Build:**
- **Agent Communication** - How agents pass information between each other
- **Tool Selection Logic** - How agents decide which tools to use when
- **Error Handling** - How agents recover from failures and continue workflows
- **State Persistence** - How to maintain context across complex agent interactions

**Key Learning Goals:**
- Understand when to use multiple agents vs single agent
- Learn your chosen framework's coordination patterns
- Practice agent prompt engineering and role design
- Build robust tool usage and error handling patterns

**üéØ Recommended Approach**: Pick ONE framework and go deep rather than trying both. Each teaches valuable but different agent patterns.

## üîß **Choose Your Agent Framework**

**Pick ONE framework and follow its implementation track:**

### **Track A: LangGraph** (Explicit Workflows)
**Best for**: Learning state management, complex routing, visual workflows

**Key Concepts**: Nodes, edges, state schemas, conditional routing
```python
# LangGraph approach: Explicit workflow graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("planner", research_planner_node)  
workflow.add_node("gatherer", research_gatherer_node)
workflow.add_conditional_edges("gatherer", should_continue)
```

### **Track B: AutoGen** (Conversational Agents)  
**Best for**: Learning agent conversations, role-based coordination, natural interactions

**Key Concepts**: Agent roles, group chats, conversation patterns
```python
# AutoGen approach: Agents converse to solve problems
researcher = AssistantAgent("Researcher", llm_config=config)
writer = AssistantAgent("Writer", llm_config=config) 
critic = AssistantAgent("Critic", llm_config=config)

user_proxy.initiate_chat(researcher, message="Research RAG systems")
```

**üéÆ Side Quest:** Add conversation memory for multi-turn research, implement research session persistence.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha:** Integration bugs are subtle. Test each integration point thoroughly before moving on.

#### **Day 11-12: Advanced Agent Features**
**Your Mission:** Add sophisticated agent behaviors and decision-making.

**What to Build:**

- **Research Session Management** - Handle long-running research workflows

**Advanced Behaviors:**
- Research Gatherer signals "RESEARCH COMPLETE" when sufficient sources collected
- Report Builder can request additional information if gaps found
- Agents track source diversity (don't over-rely on single sources)
- Intelligent caching to avoid duplicate searches

**üéÆ Side Quest:** Add collaborative research (multiple gatherer agents), implement research templates for common topics.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha:** Agent loops can become infinite. Always implement clear termination conditions.

#### **Day 13-14: Observability & Production Polish**
**Your Mission:** Make the system production-ready with comprehensive monitoring.

**What to Build:**
- **Langfuse Integration** - Complete tracing of all agent interactions (consistent with Phases 1-3)

## Common Gotchas

**Agent Loops:** Research agents can get stuck in "need more information" loops. Implement clear termination conditions.

**State Explosion:** LangGraph state can grow large with multiple agents. Use state reducers and cleanup functions.

**Cost Control:** Research workflows can be expensive with multiple LLM calls. Monitor token usage and implement budgets.

**Citation Integrity:** With multiple sources, citation tracking gets complex. Validate all citations reference real sources.

**Tool Conflicts:** Different agents using same tools can cause conflicts. Design tools to be stateless and idempotent.

**Integration Testing:** Multi-phase integration is complex. Test each connection point thoroughly.

**Observability Overhead:** Complete tracing generates lots of data. Balance visibility with performance.

Remember: Multi-agent systems are powerful but complex. Start with simple workflows and add sophistication incrementally. Focus on reliability and clear agent responsibilities over fancy features.
